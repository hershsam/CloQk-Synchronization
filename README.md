# Motivation
The ability to measure time with high precision and accuracy is an essential requirement for not just scientific exploration but also for communication, navigation and a plethora of technological applications. 
Clock synchronization determines the time difference between spatially separated clocks. 
With the increasing popularity of quantum information, quantum entanglement promises to be a useful platform for several applications of communication. This is the spirit that we apply to our project, quantum clock synchronization.

# Application
First consider a qubit with stationary states in the computational basis as $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. We introduce the Hadamard basis with states $\ket{+} = \frac{\ket{0} + \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\ket{-} = \frac{\ket{0} - \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$. At the beginning of our application, we prepare the initial entangled state:
$$\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{00}+ \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}$$
