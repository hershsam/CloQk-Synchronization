# Motivation
The ability to measure time with high precision and accuracy is an essential requirement for not just scientific exploration but also for communication, navigation and a plethora of technological applications. 
Clock synchronization determines the time difference between spatially separated clocks. 
With the increasing popularity of quantum information, quantum entanglement promises to be a useful platform for several applications of communication. This is the spirit that we apply to our project, quantum clock synchronization.

# Application
First consider a qubit with stationary states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$
